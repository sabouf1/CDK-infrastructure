This is a Git repository that contains AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) code for creating and managing AWS resources using TypeScript. The CDK stack defined in this repository creates a set of AWS resources, including a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), an EC2 instance, an Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) queue, an Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) topic, and an AWS Secrets Manager secret.

Prerequisites
Before you can use this CDK stack, you'll need the following prerequisites:

Node.js and npm installed on your development machine.
An AWS account with the necessary permissions and credentials configured.
Installation
To get started with this CDK stack, follow these steps:

Clone this Git repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
Change into the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd <repository-directory>
Install the required dependencies using npm:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Usage
You can deploy the CDK stack to your AWS environment by using the following commands:

Bootstrap the CDK environment (if you haven't already done so):

bash
Copy code
cdk bootstrap
Deploy the CDK stack:

bash
Copy code
cdk deploy
This will create the specified AWS resources defined in the MyCdkStack class within the lib/my-cdk-stack.ts file.

Configuration
The CDK stack is defined in the MyCdkStack class, and it creates the following AWS resources:

VPC: A Virtual Private Cloud with a specified CIDR range and NAT gateways.

Security Group: An EC2 Security Group associated with the VPC.

EC2 Instance: An EC2 instance launched within the VPC, with a specific instance type and Amazon Machine Image (AMI).

SQS Queue: An Amazon SQS queue.

SNS Topic: An Amazon SNS topic.

Secrets Manager Secret: An AWS Secrets Manager secret with a predefined username and a generated password.

The CDK stack also grants the EC2 instance permissions to access the Secrets Manager secret.

You can customize the configuration of these resources by modifying the code in the MyCdkStack class.

Cleanup
To remove the AWS resources created by this CDK stack, you can run the following command:

bash
Copy code
cdk destroy
This will delete the stack and its associated resources.
